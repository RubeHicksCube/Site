      <description>I just created a new static site!
In hopes of finding the most customizable, cost friendly, and user-friendly method of creating websites, I decided to go static.
Though it came as a static shock to learn how complicated it is to use a sitebuilder just to be able to use markdown to blog, it eventually worked properly and I think I have my method down.
This is using GitHub as a host, and I thought it was fun to use a github-based theme to browse the site.</description>

      <description>Welcome to RubeHicksCube!
This is a test site I wanted to make in order to test out a static site generator, which enables me to make sites using templates, but also have far better speed and control over the content of the site.
WordPress would need about 10 different plugins after installation to do what this site can do with a click of a button.
The only complication is getting it installed and actaully using it to write content.</description>
