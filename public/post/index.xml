      <description>I just created a new static site!
In hopes of finding the most customizable, cost friendly, and user-friendly method of creating websites, I decided to go static.
Though it came as a static shock to learn how complicated it is to use a sitebuilder just to be able to use markdown to blog, it eventually worked properly and I think I have my method down.
This is using GitHub as a host, and I thought it was fun to use a github-based theme to browse the site.</description>
