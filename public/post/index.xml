      <description>The main issue I have with static site generators is that they need to push their own content using scripts that, for condign newbie, are hard to understand.
The benefits of WordPress are that you can have the &amp;ldquo;new post&amp;rdquo; page bookmarked and with a single click you can have a new post going.
With hugo, you have to remember a command, ableit a simple one, to make a new document, and then push it to make an html file.</description>

      <description>Nothing of importance here. This was simply a test.
Disregard!
However, if you do find yourself here, This means that this was pushed by Netlify without the use of a second branch. Unlike GitHub Pages.
A future test will be pushing this from Cloudflare pages.</description>
