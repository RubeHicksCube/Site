I just created a new static site!

In hopes of finding the most customizable, cost friendly, and user-friendly method of creating websites, I decided to go static.

Though it came as a static shock to learn how complicated it is to use a sitebuilder just to be able to use markdown to blog, it eventually worked properly and I think I have my method down.

This is using GitHub as a host, and I thought it was fun to use a github-based theme to browse the site.

The site builder is a generator called Hugo. Based on what Google codes with in "Go" and then published with Github Pages.

The problem with this as a generator, I have to have all sorts of weird tools installed should I ever use another machine to want to blog from. 

If I'm travelling, for instance, I will have to remote in to a computer with everything installed in order to puclish my posts.

If there is an easier way to sync the backend between devices, while also only keeping the public-facing files visible to the public, then please let me know in the comments.

This is the first post on the site! I hope it works!
