# Update
I haven't touched this site for a while after making it... But I wanted to see if I could get back to it and give it an update.

I've been maintaining my WordPress sites so much that I almost forgot this one existed.

This one is still more complicated for a non-coder, but definitely less maintenance. Since I can leave this one alone for months and not have to touch it, while my WordPress sites break just by uploading photos... Makes me want to use this one more!
