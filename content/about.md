Welcome to RubeHicksCube!

This is a test site I wanted to make in order to test out a static site generator, which enables me to make sites using templates, but also have far better speed and control over the content of the site.

WordPress would need about 10 different plugins after installation to do what this site can do with a click of a button.

The only complication is getting it installed and actaully using it to write content.

I have to have a computer with the generator installed on it (which is very complicated) and then import the file into the directory, and then compile that file into a readable blog post. Assuming I do everything correctly, I might be able to sync up my files using the Obsidian/GitHub mixture I have, and then copy it to my server to compile.

Only time will tell. But thank you for visiting what is basically a test site!
